MetaData for Weather Dataset

1. year - Year at which the data was recorded
2. month - Month at which the data was recorded
3. day - Day at which the data was recorded
4. tempHigh - Maximum temperature observed during that date
5. tempAvg - Average temperature of that date
6. tempLow - Minimum temperature observed during that date
7. DPHigh - Maximum Dew Point of that day
8. DPAvg - Average Dew Point of that day
9. DPLow - Minimum Dew Point of that day
	Dew Point - the temperature the air needs to be cooled in order to achieve a relative humility of 100%. At this point air cannot hold more water in gas form.
10. humidityHigh - Maximum likelihood for precipitation in that date
11. humidityAvg - Average likelihood for precipitation in that date
12. humidityLow - Minimum likelihood for precipitation in that date
	humidity - Most of the time rainfall occurs when relative humidity reaches 90-100%.
13. SLPHigh - Maximum pressure observed during that date
14. SLPAvg - Average pressure observed during that date
15. SLPLow - Minimum pressure observed during that date
	Sea Level Pressure - Low pressure usually means cloudy, rainy, or windy.
16. visibilityHigh - Maximum visibility observed during that date
17. visibilityAvg - Average visibility observed during that date
18. visibilityLow - Minimum visibility observed during that date
19. windAvg - Average wind speed observed during that date
20. Rainfall - Amount of rainfall experienced during that date
21. AQI - Air Quality Index of that date
	AQI - as AQI decreases, water droplets get scattered and are prevented from combining.
